For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the replication study. You do not need to attempt to reproduce the findings of Roskes et al.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and the "new data" section of Table 1:

> In Table 1, we provide the main results using both
Roskes et al.â€™s data and the new data that we collected.
The earlier study revealed a greater propensity for the
goalkeepers to dive to the right when their team was
behind (70.8%) versus when their team was tied or ahead
(49.0% and 46.3%, respectively). Our new data show a
smaller difference based on the game situation (65.6%
when their team was behind, 56.0% when tied, 55.6%
when ahead), and none of these percentages are statistically
significantly different from each other.
